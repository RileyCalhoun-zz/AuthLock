## Building with Maven
Building the project files with maven is a pretty straight forward process as long as you have some experience with maven.

1. Download the project's source code
2. Start a powershell terminal in the folder
3. Type "mvn package" and press enter
#### The build will not complete. It will say "build failed" but the jar will still export to the target folder. A fix is coming for this soon.
